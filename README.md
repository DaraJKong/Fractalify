## Download and Installation
1. Download the add-on:

|Version|Blender Version|Download URL|
|---|---|---|
|v1.0 |[Blender 2.93](https://www.blender.org/download/releases/2-93/)|[Download](https://github.com/DaraJKong/Fractalify/releases/tag/v1.0)|

The simplest method is to download directly the .zip file containing \__init__.py, not the entire repository as a .zip file. The reason is you need to have the correct add-on structure for it to install properly into Blender.

2. Open the User Preferences in Blender (Edit > Preferences...). In the "Add-ons" tab, click on the "Install..." button. Then find the .zip file you downloaded and select it. The add-on should now appear in the window.

3. Tick the checkbox next to the name of the add-on. If the add-on did not appear in the list, just search for "Fractalify" in the input field. If you do not have the "Auto-Save Preferences" option enabled, save the user preferences. This will ensure the add-on gets loaded everytime you open Blender.

## How to use

Once the addon is installed, you will find it in many ways. The best way is to open the right side panel (N). There you will find a tab named "Fractalify" with a user-friendly interface. You can also access the add-on under "Object > Quick Effects > Fractalify" in the 3D Viewport.
